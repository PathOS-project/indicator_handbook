## Description

This indicator aims to capture the prevalence of funding being provided for Open Science. It is closely related to the indicator for prevalence of national policies for Open Science. Since Open Science can be considered a catch-all term for different practices and objectives, this may include different elements or distinct policies such as Open Access to publications, Open Data, fair data, research assessment reform, Citizen Science etc. Usually, the question whether funding is provided is part of a policy. I.e., the availability of funding implies the existence of a policy as well.

Practically, funding might be available at various levels. It can be international, national, regional, institutional (RPOs, HEIs, RFOs etc.) or even departmental.

Knowing the existence of Open Science funding policies can be helpful to evaluate the overall commitment of funding organizations, governments, and private entities to advancing Open Science practices and fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration in research. Researchers can assess the extent to which funding agencies prioritize Open Access publishing, data sharing, and other Open Science practices, which can influence their decisions on where to submit grant proposals and seek financial support for their projects.

Furthermore, being aware of these policies enables researchers to align their research projects with the values and objectives of funding organizations that actively promote Open Science. By adhering to Open Science principles in their proposals and research activities, researchers can increase their chances of securing funding and potentially gain access to additional resources, such as Open Science infrastructure and collaborative networks.

Beyond individual researchers, understanding the landscape of Open Science funding policies can also inform policymakers, institutions, and advocacy groups about the progress and impact of Open Science initiatives. It allows them to identify areas where more support and resources are needed to strengthen the Open Science ecosystem and accelerate the transition to a more open and transparent research culture. Paired with impact and other Open Science indicators, the existence of policies and funding can be expected to be an important determinant for Open Science practices to increase.

In summary, knowledge of Open Science funding policies empowers researchers and stakeholders to make informed decisions, promote Open Science practices, and contribute to a more inclusive and accessible global research community.
