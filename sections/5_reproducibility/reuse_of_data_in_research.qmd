## Description

The reuse of data in research refers to the practice of utilizing existing data sets for new research questions. It is a common practice in various scientific fields, and it can lead to increased scientific efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced scientific collaborations. Additionally, the reuse of well-documented data can serve as an independent verification of original findings, thereby enhancing the reproducibility of research. This indicator aims to capture the extent to which researchers engage in the reuse of data in their research, by quantifying the number and proportion of studies that utilize previously collected data. The indicator can be used to assess the level of scientific collaboration and sharing of data within a specific scientific community or field, and to identify potential barriers or incentives for the reuse of data in research. Additionally, it can serve as a measure of the quality and reliability of research, as the reuse of data can increase the transparency, validity, and replicability of research findings.

### Connections to Academic Indicators

This indicator emphasizes the adoption and utilization of existing datasets for new research purposes, highlighting its role in enhancing reusability, reproducibility, collaboration, and research efficiency. In contrast, the [Use of Data in Research](https://handbook.pathos-project.eu/indicator_templates/sections/2_academic_impact/use_of_data_in_research.html) focuses on the initial incorporation of data into research activities and its contributions to academic outputs. Furthermore, the [Impact of Open Data in Research](https://handbook.pathos-project.eu/indicator_templates/sections/5_reproducibility/impact_of_open_data_in_research.html) extends this perspective by evaluating how openly shared datasets foster transparency, accessibility, and innovation across the scientific community.

## Metrics

### Number of datasets reused in publications

This metric emphasizes the reuse of datasets in research publications, highlighting its importance in fostering reproducibility, collaboration, and research efficiency. The reuse of datasets serves as an essential mechanism for validating findings and building upon prior research, enhancing the transparency and replicability of scientific outputs.

This aligns closely with the metrics discussed in the [Use of Data in Research](https://handbook.pathos-project.eu/indicator_templates/sections/2_academic_impact/use_of_data_in_research.html) under the academic indicators. Specifically, the measurement of dataset mentions or citations in publications provides the foundation for assessing both the use and reuse of data. For further details on measurement methodologies, such as text mining, and the role of data repositories, refer to the academic indicator.

In the context of reproducibility, the reuse of datasets reflects the scientific community's ability to leverage existing data to answer new research questions. It underscores the importance of effective data sharing practices, robust metadata, and clear licensing, as these enable other researchers to trust, access, and incorporate datasets into their work. Furthermore, higher levels of data reuse often indicate stronger collaboration and trust within a scientific field, which are critical for advancing reproducible research.

By interpreting dataset reuse through the lens of reproducibility, this indicator also highlights the extent to which researchers adopt transparent and open research practices. The repeated utilization of datasets ensures that original findings are validated and that the data itself is robust, reliable, and suitable for diverse applications.

##### Datasources

###### OpenAIRE

OpenAIRE is a European Open Science platform that provides access to millions of openly available research publications, datasets, software, and other research outputs. OpenAIRE aggregates content from various sources, including institutional and thematic repositories, data archives, and publishers. This platform provides usage statistics for each research output in the form of downloads, views, and citations, which can be used to measure the impact and reuse of research outputs, including Open Datasets.

To measure the proposed metric, [OpenAIRE Explore](https://explore.openaire.eu/) can be used to find and access Open Datasets, study their usage statistics, and identify the research publications that reference them.

However, it's important to note that OpenAIRE Explore does not provide comprehensive data for directly calculating the metric, but rather provides the publication references of each Open Software that need to be analysed.

###### DataCite

[DataCite](https://datacite.org/) is a global registry of research data repositories and datasets, providing persistent identifiers for research data to ensure that they are discoverable, citable, and reusable. The dataset landing pages on DataCite contain information about the dataset, such as metadata, version history, and download statistics.

To measure the proposed metric, we can employ the DataCite REST API to identify relevant datasets, along with to find their DOI, metadata and usage statistics.

##### Existing methodologies


###### DataSeer.ai

[DataSeer.ai](https://dataseer.ai/) is a platform that utilizes machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate the detection and extraction of datasets, methods, and software mentioned in academic papers. The platform can be used to identify instances of dataset reuse within the text of research articles and extract associated metadata.

To measure the proposed metric, DataSeer.ai can scan the body of text in research articles and identify instances of dataset reuse.

However, it is important to note that DataSeer.ai's ability to determine actual data reuse may depend on the explicitness of the authors' writing about their data usage, thus not capturing all instances of dataset reuse if they are not explicitly mentioned in the text. Moreover, the machine learning algorithms used by the tool may not always accurately classify whether a dataset has been reused, and may require manual validation.
