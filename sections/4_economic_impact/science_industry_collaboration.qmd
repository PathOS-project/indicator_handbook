A high number or percentage of such patents indicate a strong science-industry linkage and a productive exchange of OS resources.

This metric is a good operationalization of the indicator because it provides a direct measure of the output of collaborative efforts. However, it may not capture the quality or impact of the collaboration. It differs from other metrics by focusing on legal intellectual property outcomes rather than purely academic outputs.

### Measurement

Utilize the PATSTAT dataset (<https://www.epo.org/en/searching-for-patents/business/patstat>) to identify patents filed by industry partners in collaboration with academic institutions. Examine the citations within these patents for references to papers or other resources that are recognized as open science inputs. Specifically, determine if these patents cite papers that contribute to new open science resources or artifacts.

**Methodology**:

**Step 1: Data Collection**. Access the PATSTAT database for comprehensive patent data, focusing on patents that result from industry-academia collaborations, based on inventor affiliations and patent assignments.

**Step 2: Citation Analysis**. Examine the NPL (Non-patent literature) citations within these patents for references to open science inputs such as papers, datasets, or software, identifying those that directly relate to open science principles.

**Step 3: Identification of Open Science Inputs**. Establish criteria for what qualifies as an open science input and validate these against recognized open access repositories and directories.

**Step 4: Quantification**. Calculate the number and percentage of identified patents that cite Open Science (OS) inputs, providing a measure of the extent of science-industry collaboration. To further assess the quality and impact of these patents, include the following dimensions, which can be acquired using the PATSTAT database:

-   **Patent Citations**: Analyze forward citations from other patents to measure the influence of the patents within the scientific and industrial communities. A higher number of citations suggests greater adoption and impact of the innovation.
-   **Grant Status**: Determine whether the patents were granted, as granted patents often reflect higher-quality innovations that meet stricter evaluation criteria. PATSTAT includes information on the legal status of patents, which can be used to identify granted patents.
-   **Non-Patent Literature (NPL) Citations**: Count the number of references to academic articles, datasets, or other Open Science resources within the patent. These citations, available in the NPL fields in PATSTAT, indicate the level of integration of scholarly outputs in the patent.

By leveraging PATSTAT data, these metrics can provide a more comprehensive and multidimensional measure of the extent and quality of science-industry collaborations utilizing Open Science inputs.

**Step 5: Analysis and Reporting**. Analyze the data to understand the nature and extent of the collaborations, including any limitations or challenges encountered in data collection and analysis, such as incomplete citation information or difficulties in distinguishing open science inputs.

**Challenges** may include accurately identifying collaborations and open science inputs, dealing with incomplete citation records, and accessing the necessary databases. This approach aims to provide a structured methodology for assessing the impact of open science on innovation and collaboration between academia and industry.
