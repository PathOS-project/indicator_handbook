# Introduction

This repository contains the source files in Quarto for the PathOS impact indicator handbook available from https://handbook.pathos-project.eu/. Quarto is a file format that can be used to write technical documents, including support for equations, citations, cross-references and code. Extensive documentation about the file format is available from https://quarto.org/docs/guide/.

The indicators, and other related material, are stored in the various `sections`, corresponding to the various parts of the website: (1) Causality; (2) Open Science indicators; (3) Academic impact; (4) Economic impact; (5) Societal impact; (6) Reproducibility. In each directory, there are various `.qmd` files, which contain the specific indicators or chapters.
